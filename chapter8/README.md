If we start from 0,0 position, then this problem is more difficult.
because what if the last position(r-1 or c-1) is off limits?
So, let's think of processing from r,c and we are using boolean array. map[r][c], r : row, c : column
Also, we are using HashSet for caching. that's because we have to skip a past failed path.
